# The Moodle Community

Moodle has a huge community with users and contributors across the globe.

## Community forums

## Developer chat

The Official Moodle Developer chat is currently hosted using [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org).

You can be a part of the conversation by joining the [#moodledev](https://telegram.me/moodledev) channel. 

### Developer chat policies

**Don't use the chat to get support for using Moodle**

There are moodle.org forums for that, or talk to a Moodle Partner

**Be nice**

Help us maintain a great developer community:
* Be respectful to others' viewpoints.
* Give and accept the constructive feedback and eventually criticism, too.
* Be honest, but not offensive.

**Speak English in the chat.**

Moodle is a global project with worldwide community and English - even on elementary level - works best for us.

**Use your real name in the chat.**

Keep it consistent with your moodle.org profile and Git commits.

**Keep topics and discussions focused.**

Everything you post in the chat, hits several hundreds of other people instantly. Let us not disturb each other.

**Avoid funny animated gifs, memes and stickers.**

There are better places online for sharing them.

**Advertising is generally not allowed, although certain exceptions may be made.**
