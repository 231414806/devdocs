Plugins may define a '/styles.css' to provide plugin-specific styling. See the following for further documentation:

- [[Plugin contribution checklist#CSS styles]]
- [[CSS Coding Style]]

:::tip Avoid custom styles where possible

Rather than writing custom CSS for your plugin, where possible apply Bootstrap classes to the DOM elements in your output. These will be easier to maintain and will adopt most colour, branding, and other customisations applied to a theme.
