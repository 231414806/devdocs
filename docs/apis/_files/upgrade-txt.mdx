Each component and subsystem may make use of an `upgrade.txt` file in the top level folder. A title is used to identify the Moodle version where the change was introduced, and significant changes for that version relating to that component or subsystem are displayed.

When changes are integrated to multiple branches, for example a stable version and the master branch, then the relevant versions used to describe the change in the `upgrade.txt` file should be the next version to be released _for each branch_. The `master` branch should always use the next major version.

For example if a change is applied to the **MOODLE_400_STABLE** during the development of Moodle 4.0.2, and the **master** branch during the development of Moodle 4.1, then the relevant versions will be **4.0.2** and **4.1**.

If a change is only applied to the master branch then only the **4.1** version will be listed.

:::note Exception during parallel development

When Moodle is developing two major versions in parallel, for example Moodle 3.11.0, and Moodle 4.0.0, then the
version in the earliest of the major version development branches will be used for both branches.

For example, during the development of Moodle 3.11, and Moodle 4.0, which took place in parallel, if a change was integrated to 3.11 and 4.0, then the version specified in both branches would be 3.11.
