In older versions of Moodle, JavaScript was written in the YUI format. This is being phased out in favour of [JavaScript Modules](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Javascript_Modules), although some older uses still remain in Moodle core.

- [YUI](../../guides/javascript/yui/index.md)

:::caution

New YUI code will not be accepted into Moodle core, except for new plugins for the [Atto editor](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Atto).
