In older versions of Moodle, JavaScript was written in the YUI format. This is being phased out in favour of [[Javascript Modules]], although some older uses still remain in Moodle core.

- [[YUI/Modules]]
- [[YUI]]

:::caution

New YUI code will not be accepted into Moodle core, except for new plugins for the [[Atto|Atto editor]].
