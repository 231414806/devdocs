## A quick start to Moodle development

There are several ways to get started with Moodle depending on whether you prefer to use a container environment like
docker, or to run Moodle on your machine directly.

Several tools have been created by Moodle developers to make the development process easier for everyone. We welcome you
to try these out and see if they help in your own workflows.

### Docker

It is safe to assume that Docker has already been installed.

### MacOS

If you prefer to have all of your development directly on your machine, without the use of Docker, then there are two
main approaches. Many prefer to install packages using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), whilst others prefer
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). Both are powerful approaches and the choice is yours.

#### Homebrew

We can highly recommend this guide, courtesy of [Grav](https://getgrav.org/).
It details installing your web development environment on MacOS using Homebrew:
