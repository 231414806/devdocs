We are looking to implement both a coding style guide, and a writing style guide, for this documentation. This will include appropriate tooling and information.

For more information see the discussions for each topic:

- [Writing style guide](https://github.com/moodle/devdocs/issues/49).
- [Coding style guide](https://github.com/moodle/devdocs/issues/48).

We would appreciate your feedback on this important topic.
