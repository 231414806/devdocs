(Because this release contains important security fixes, we highly advise that sites using any previous version of Moodle upgrade to this version as soon as possible.)

### Some important security fixes

- Preventative measures against attacks to admin functions.
- Lesson: Safer hiding of lessons ([#2733](http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2733))

### A few new things

- Flash Media Player: Now playing can start before the download is complete.
- Added/updated language support for German (DE) and Turkish (TR).
- Release notes now link to the relevant bugs.
- Prefetching requests from Google Web Accelerator, Mozilla etc are denied.

### Performance improvements

- Added option to cache the languages list. Saves around 10MB of memory and 40 includes. See config-dist.php for details on how to enable.
- Major efficiency improvements for Postgres databases on insert. Also fixed many calls to insert_record() which discard the returned record id to not ask for the record id.

- Additional/updated translations.
- Forums and Groups: Allow students not in a group to post into a discussion which is also not in a group, even if the course is using groups.

- Cron: Removed some warnings.
- Choice: Choice shows a bad number of answers ([#2452](http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2452)).
- Better support for PHP5: Files uploads now use $_FILES rather than deprecated $HTTP_POST_FILES ([#2828](http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2828))
